Hello, thank you for reading me. 

I used C for this project. All my programs compiled and run successfully. 
I will list the commands since some of them take arguments.
I put all the functions in a .h file and #include "function.h" in the header for Q3 and Q4
Professor said it is ok to #include a .h file. 
If you have any questions , please email kxy200010@utdallas.edu

Question 1 command:
make
./cal.exe "cal.in"
//"cal.in" is argument 


Question 2 command
bash execute.sh "sum" 
//"sum" is the argument, which is the s variable.

Question 3 compile:
gcc -c admin.c
gcc -o admin admin.o
./admin


Question 4 compile : 
gcc -c adminNew2.c
gcc -c cal-new.c
gcc -o adminNew2 adminNew2.o cal-new.o triples.o quadratic.o sum.o -lm
./adminNew2

Question 5 compile: 
gcc -o pthread pthread.o
gcc -o pthread pthread.o -lpthread
./pthread
